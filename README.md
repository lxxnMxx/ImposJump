# **IMPOSJUMP** ...

... is a hard platform jump and run game for windows and also for Linux. ImposJump is a project I really love and I want that you can use it too.

And this repo includes all the code I've wrote and the assets I've made for this project. That means that ImposJump is now open source available, so YOU can reuse and adjust them in your own project.
